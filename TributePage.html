      <h2 id="tribute-info"> <strong> Top Quotes </strong> </h2>
        <l>
        <li> Act before you think - your instincts are more honest than your thoughts.</li>
    <li> Your acting will not be good until it is only yours. That's true of music, acting, anything creative. You work until finally nobody is acting like you. </li>
        <li> Life beats down and crushes our souls and theatre reminds us that we have one. At least the type of theatre that I'm interested in; that is, theatre that moves an audience. You have the opportunity to literally impact the lives of people if they work on material that has integrity. But today, most actors simply want to be famous. Well, being an actor was never supposed to be about fame and money. Being an actor is a religious calling because you've been given the ability, the gift to inspire humanity. Think about that on the way to your soap opera audition.</li>
